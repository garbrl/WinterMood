# Login Example

This is a brief login example using cookies for session storage. Given how hastilly this was put together, there are definetly a few minor bugs and probably some major security vulnrabilities (if this were a real website, anyways). 


Files of particular note:

- config/routes.rb
- app/models/user.rb
- app/models/session.rb
- app/index.html.erb
- app/controllers/login_controller.rb
