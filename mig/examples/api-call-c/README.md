# Example API call written in C


This is a (quicky written) example of an API call for getting weather data

This compiles fine on my computer (Linux) but I've been unable to test
whether or not it compiles for windows (with mingw). The code requires
that one has the 'wget' binary available within the environment path. 
Other binaries which function as HTTP clients may well function, though
this would require a change to the wget format string, and possibly
other minor formatting issues
