# CMPT 276 group project

Specific project idea has yet to be determined.

At present, the following are being considered:


1. Reddit: Reddit is a forum where users can edit or delete posts. We want to allow users to log into our site and choose users to track. Not only will they be able to see all posts by the respective user, but they will see which posts have been deleted.
2. SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder): We want users to be able to register, select their area and periodically identify their mood. We can then analyze their data and correlations between the weather and their mood to identify if they have SAD.
3. Spotify: For users that have different music playlists on YouTube and Spotify, we will create a program that automatically updates both playlists to be in sync with each other. If you add a song to one, our program will add it to the other.


This will be updated once we have a definitive decision.
